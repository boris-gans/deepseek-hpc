  Quantum entanglement has often been described as one of the most mysterious phenomena in modern physics. Provide a detailed explanation, beginning with the basic concept of classical correlations between particles, and then contrast this with quantum entanglement. Include an explanation of Bell’s theorem, local realism, and the experimental evidence that demonstrates the nonlocal nature of entangled systems. Discuss why this fundamentally challenges the assumptions of classical physics and what implications it has for quantum communication and computing.
